                <p class="writing">I like The Odin Project. It isn’t as fast or as user friendly as other code teaching sites, but it has its benefits. Right off the bat the throw you into really doing stuff. I get on Git, you learn command line, you have to go and register for all sorts of stuff. It doesn’t hold your hand, but rather throws you in the water and tells you to swim. It really helped me get some concepts that I had learned in other places to click. It isn’t for the faint of heart, but you learn a lot and do a lot.</p>
